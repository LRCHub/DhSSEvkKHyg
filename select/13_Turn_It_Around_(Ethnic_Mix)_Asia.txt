Oh,oh
Took the ground from underneath my feet
Silent town,ghosts this empty street
I see the home that once was mine
Now just bones of former life
Touch this page of sacred time, again,
I see you call

You don't have to be strong for me
I won't shoot your defenses down
Whatever happens, I want you to see
We can face it together, turn it around

A new life grows within his hands
I'm coming back to this promised land
And with these bones we will rebuild
To the flesh of future life
Giving back that sacred time, again
I see you call

You don't have to be strong for me
I won't shoot your defenses down
Whatever happens, I want you to see
We can face it together, turn it around

You don't have to be strong for me
I won't shoot your defenses down
Whatever happens, I want you to see
We can face it together, turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
