Several times I've tried
Everything to make you feel alright
(Turn it around)
Is anything working?
(Turn it around)

Several times I've died inside
And then I see you get uptight
(Turn it around)
We gotta get back
(Turn it around)

Well, I've got time on my side
(Turn it around)
And you've got time on your side
(Turn it around)
Now it's only time to decide
Which side you're on

We've tried everything in sight
(Turn it around)
To make it turn out all right
(Turn it around)

Now is the only time
Now is the only time
Now it's time
To try to turn it around

Several times I've wished
That everything would slip into a void
(Turn it around)
Does it even matter now?
(Turn it around)

It's time to figure out
The things we want and things that we'll avoid
(Turn it around)
We gotta get back
(Turn it around)

Well, I don't grab for straws anymore
(Turn it around)
And you don't sink your claws anymore
(Turn it around)
But the more I think
The less I really know about myself

We gotta turn it around
(Turn it around)
Before it goes into the ground
(Turn it around)

Now is the only time
Now is the only time
Now it's time
To try to turn it around

Several times
Tried to turn it around
Several ways
Tried to turn it around

Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around

Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around

Several morals and there's several plays
Several parts that anyone can try
(Turn it around)
It's enough to make you cry
(Turn it around)

I may not think that I'm right
But I know the things I've got
Are gonna turn out alright
(Turn it around)
We gotta get back, turn it around
(Turn it around)

Well, I may not be anything
(Turn it around)
And you might be the biggest thing
(Turn it around)
The biggest thing to me
Is making this thing work for life

We gotta turn it around
(Turn it around)
Before it goes into the ground
(Turn it around)

Now is the only time
Now is the only time
Now it's time
To try to turn it around

Several times
Tried to turn it around
Several ways
Tried to turn it around

Several times
Tried to turn it around
Several ways
Tried to turn it around
