Turn it around baby
Spend more time with me
Try to believe you, try to believe you
Turn it around baby
Spend more time with me
It's getting insane I know
Let it not be true
Turn it around baby
Turn it around

I need you
I can only be myself with you
I need you
I can olnly be myself with you
I can only be myself

Turn it around baby
It's just my jealousy
I don't want to lose you
Don't wanna to lose you
Turn it around baby
We've come too far
Don't let this slip away
Don't leave me now
Turn it around baby
Turn it around

I need you
I can only be myself with you
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I can only be myself

I can only be myself
I can only be myself
