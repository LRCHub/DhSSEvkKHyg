# A-One – Turn It Around

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
No matter how,
how fast I ran away
I couldn’t catch my breath
You took the air,
the wind out of my sails
You made sure nothing was left
How does it feel
all burning down?
This is real
for you now
I can turn it around
Hit it right back to you
I can shout it aloud
All of us see through you
Bring me
Back to (When)
I never
Knew you
All you do will burn in the
Searing light of truth
Did you forget the fatal
consequence
You never left me alone
I’ll do you in,
you’re never going back
Much further out on your own
How does it feel
all burning down?
This is real
for you now
I can turn it around
Hit it right back to you
I can shout it aloud
All of us see through you
Bring me
Back to (When)
I never
Knew you
All you do will burn in the
Searing light of truth
How does it feel
all burning down?
This is real
for you now
I can turn it around
Hit it right back to you
I can shout it aloud
All of us see through you
Bring me
Back to (When)
I never
Knew you
All you do will burn in the
Searing light of truth
